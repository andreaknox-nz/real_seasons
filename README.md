## About this project

In 2014 a [new classification of Wellingtonâ€™s seasons](https://twitter.com/adamshand/status/513197000930521089?cxt=HHwWgsCTxIH9np8OAAAA) was proposed by Adam Shand that renames _spring_ to _shitsville_ and creates a new season of _spring 1 and 2_ from August and December. The proposal has been popular, with several hundred retweets, a spin-off [website](https://www.realnzweather.com), and [t-shirt](https://shitsville.printmighty.co.nz) sales.  

In an attempt to create a supporting evidence base, we used Wellington and Auckland weather data from the [National Insitute for Water and Atmospheric Research](https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/) to assess whether the conventional seasons or these new seasons better described observed weather patterns. 

You can read a [summary report](https://andreaknox-nz.github.io/real_seasons/summary_report_less_technical/summary_report.html) (suitable for non-statisticians) on our results.

If you want more, please visit our [github repository](https://github.com/andreaknox-nz/real_seasons) where you will find the full (much more technical) report, our data and our code.
