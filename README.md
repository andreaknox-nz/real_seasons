## A comparison of seasonal classifications for Wellington and Auckland weather

In 2014 Adam Shand proposed a new classification of Wellington’s seasons that splits spring into two periods (August and December) and renames the period from September to November as “Shitsville” (https://twitter.com/adamshand/status/513197000930521089?cxt=HHwWgsCTxIH9np8OAAAA). This proposal has received support including several hundred retweets, a spin-off website (https://www.realnzweather.com), and t-shirt sales (https://shitsville.printmighty.co.nz).  

In an attempt to initiate a supporting evidence base, we used Wellington and Auckland weather data from the National Insitute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) to assess whether the conventional seasons or this new classification better describes observed weather patterns. This repository contains the results, code and data from this analysis.

We recommend you start with the non-technical report. If you want more, the final report (technical) includes full details of our methods and results.

Evidence is never perfect and results can be interpreted in different ways. We'd be happy to hear your comments and suggestions for improvements. Hate-mail is fine but may not receive a polite response :)
