## About this project

In 2014 Adam Shand proposed a [new classification of Wellington’s seasons](https://twitter.com/adamshand/status/513197000930521089?cxt=HHwWgsCTxIH9np8OAAAA) that splits spring into two periods (August and December) and renames the period from September to November as “Shitsville”. This proposal has received support including several hundred retweets, a spin-off [website](https://www.realnzweather.com), and [t-shirt](https://shitsville.printmighty.co.nz) sales.  

In an attempt to initiate a supporting evidence base, we used Wellington and Auckland weather data from the [National Insitute for Water and Atmospheric Research](https://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/) to assess whether the conventional seasons or this new classification better describes observed weather patterns. 

Here is a [non-technical report](https://andreaknox-nz.github.io/real_seasons/non_technical_report/Non-technical_report_html.html) describing our results.

If you want to know more, you can visit our [github repository](https://github.com/andreaknox-nz/real_seasons) for the project, where you will find the full (and more technical) final report, our data and our code.

Evidence is never perfect and results can be interpreted in different ways. We'd be happy to hear your comments and suggestions for improvements.
