# A comparison of seasonal classifications for Wellington and Auckland weather

in 2014 Adam Shand proposed a new classification of Wellington’s seasons that splits spring into two periods (August and December) and renames the period from September to November as “Shitsville” (https://twitter.com/adamshand/status/513197000930521089?cxt=HHwWgsCTxIH9np8OAAAA).  

We used Wellington and Auckland weather data from the National Insitute for Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) to assess whether the conventional seasons or this new classification better describe observed weather patterns. This repository contains the results, code, and data from this analysis.
